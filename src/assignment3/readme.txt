A3 - group 36
Our group members: David Rocha, Mariia Zabolotnia

Our group decided to initially split work in two global parts - company class and methods that David started developing
and Employee hierarchy and some connected methods in the company class was Mariia's responsibility.
Before starting with the tasks, we had a discussion to brainstorm over the methods to approach the assignment.
After the skeleton was done, we joined our powers and finished refactoring and developing the project together.
